# hotels

A new Flutter project based on the [video of Driss AS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8_kXpMeps&t=36s).

# Informations
This is my second flutter project.

I Followed Driss As' video from begginning to end : [Flutter Tutorial Français: Créer Le Design D’une Application De Réservation d'Hôtel Avec Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8_kXpMeps&t=36s). And I made some modifications to try to improve the code proposed in the video.

This application is 2 pages of booking application. One is the hotels' list and the second is a calendar to select the desired reservation days.
